Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in the dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-pool full of liquor I'ma dive in it
Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I'm your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down I'ma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me
Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-pool full of liquor I'ma dive in it

I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, 100 shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, 200 shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, 100 shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, 200 shots, bang
Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?

(Pool full of Kendrick's lies in it)
(W-watch 'em all flock)
Aw man, where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me? (Pool full of liquor I'ma die in it)
All I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got Hunger pain that grow insane, tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in -'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see someone
Aha, got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
L-, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good, Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin', Dave?
These bitch ass niggas killed my brother",2012-01-01,1,4

5,DAUGHTER,0.374,Beyoncé,3,8,none,"Your body laid out on these filthy floors
Your bloodstains on my custom coutures
Bathroom attendant let me right in
She was a big fan
I really tried to stay cool
But your arrogance disturbed my solitude
Now I ripped your dress and you're all black and blue
Look what you made me do
They keep sayin' that I ain't nothin' like my father
But I'm the furthest thing from choir boys and altars
If you cross me, I'm just like my father
I am colder than Titanic water
Help me, Lord, from these fantasies in my head
They ain't ever been safe ones
I don't fellowship with these fake ones
So let's travel to white chapels and sing hymns
Hold rosaries and sing in stained-glass symphonies
Cleanse me, Holy Trinity, from this marijuana smoke smell in my hair
I sashayed my dress
Did my best impression of a damsel in distress
This alcohol and smell of regret
Allured my catch
Outfit too small to hide my scars
Feelin' bottled up like bottle service broads
How long can he hold his breath before his death?
Caro mio ben
Credimi almen
Senza di te
Languisce il cor
Il tuo fedel
Sospira ognor
Cessa, crudel
Tanto rigor

Ooh

7,Chemtrails Over The Country Club,0.334,Lana Del Rey,3,10,none,"I'm on the run with you, my sweet love
There's nothing wrong contemplating God
Under the chemtrails over the country club
Wearing our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playing it cool
Under the chemtrails over the country club
Take out your turquoise and all of your jewels
Go to the market, the kids' swimming pools
Baby, what's your sign?
My moon's in Leo, my Cancer is sun
You won't play, you're no fun
Well, I don't care what they think
Drag racing my little red sports car
I'm not unhinged or unhappy, I'm just wild
I'm on the run with you, my sweet love
There's nothing wrong contemplating God
Under the chemtrails over the country club
Wearing our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playing it cool
Under the chemtrails over the country club
Meet you for coffee at the elementary schools
We laugh about nothing as the summer gets cool
It's beautiful how this deep normality settles down over me
I'm not bored or unhappy, I'm still so strange and wild
You're in the wind, I'm in the water
Nobody's son, nobody's daughter
Watching the chemtrails over the country club
Suburbia, The Brentwood Market
What to do next? Maybe we'll love it
White picket chemtrails over the country club
My love, my love
Washing my hair, doing the laundry
Late-night TV, I want you only
Like when we were kids under chemtrails and country clubs
It's never too late, baby, so don't give up

She paid to view, that's an on-demand
Hey, Guy-Man, brought him home from France
This shit punk, put it on the Bible
I like a bi girl on a bi-cycle
Then I bought a car, now she feel entitled
My dick so hard, pokin' likе the Eiffel
I just need the world, I ain't hard to plеase

True upgrader, you a shaker
Car breaker

Got the glow and it got to show
Know it's been a year since I seen the road
Had me inside like I'm on parole
I'm outside like I'm on patrol
I hear the zeitgeist, now I'm in the zone
You know they say you up when you finally free
It won't feel right if it's only me
If you're scared, nigga, say your grace
I got the formula like I own the race
I got the keys with me like I own the place
If these niggas on top, then I'm outta space

There go my ego again, that's the problem
The fuck you expect? I go get what I want
I want you to say you pick me with your voice
I'm twenty-five up, but I can't buy your choice
You promised to me, but that's not the point
You got me out here smokin' joints
You got me out here losin' point

11,As,0.467,Stevie Wonder,3,12,none,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always
always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high) always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea) always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always
As today I know I'm living but tomorrow
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Until the ocean severs every mountain high) always
We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That god knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Loving you
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Loving you
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Loving you
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Until the day that is the day that are no more

But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him

Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself, ""This could be heaven or this could be hell""
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year)
You can find it here""
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes-Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain, ""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still, those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)

They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)

Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice

And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast

I had to find the passage back to the place I was before

En t'attendant j'observe les liens que les passants nouent
Il fut un temps où la beauté du ciel venait pas sans nous
Les autres femmes manquent de sel je ne croque pas un bout de ces repas sans goût
À l'esprit j'ai des images de tes cheveux qui repassent en boucle
Mais t'es toujours pas là et le jour s'étire
J'commence vraiment à m'inquiéter pour toi le sais-tu?
Aujourd'hui c'est dur, demain c'est pire
Et ta jalousie me donne envie de toutes les séduire
Mais je reste fidèle par respect, ça je l'ai juré
T'es la seule qui me paraît spéciale, tous les jours alors
Je reste fidèle par respect, ça je l'ai juré
T'es la seule qui me paraît spéciale
Tu jetteras mes affaires encore et tout c'qui pourrait traîner
Même un livre que je t'ai prêté, j'ai un visage pour être aimé
Tu m'as dis ""quand est-c'que tu vas t'arrêter d'idéaliser
L'amour dans les livres tout en me négligeant?""
Quoi? Toi, tu crois connaître les gens?
Vérité dantesque
J'ai le cœur en dentelle mais j'suis qu'un mur en tant qu'tel
Tu f'ras la tête mais j'ai un cadeau sous ma parka
Ton sourire énervé j'le connais par cœur
Alors on escaladera des grilles, on ira dans un parc
Et si l'gardien nous grille, on modifiera le parcours
Embrouille pleine de frivolité rue de Rivoli
Une plaisante rivalité, jusqu'à c'qu'on arrive au lit
Tu vois, j'te connais par cœur
À croire qu'les embrouilles je les cherche
Mais pour l'instant j'me les gèle et je regarde l'heure
Le café vient de fermer mais j'suis devant j'reste
Quelle idée d'aimer une femme à l'humeur vengeresse?
La dernière fois j't'ai mis un plan, pas d'quoi péter un plomb
Mais tu viens d'une ville dangereuse
Tu voulais plus t'poser
T'avais tout fait pour t'aguerrir beauté
Mais moi j'ai tout fait pour t'acquérir
On aime pleurer autant que rire pourquoi fallait-il qu'on pose cette base?
Peur de souffrir j'étais distant comme pour dire ""tu m'possèdes pas""
Pardon bébé partons, marre de cette vie d'rap
Tu m'as dis ""c'est faux tu l'f'ras jamais, c'est moi qu'tu quitteras""
Et c'était faux, enfin, j-j'ai nié sous le seum
Cette vé-, cette vérité retentissante
Espèce de lâche, rassure-toi en te disant que c'est la vie
Et que toute façon le génie est souvent seul
Le café vient de fermer, tu ne viendras plus
Je sens le dernier métro gronder sous mes pattes
Quelle idée d'aimer cette femme qu'on ne soumet pas?
C'est plutôt nul comme fin, en plus ça nique le r'frain",2016-12-02,1,4
